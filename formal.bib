The book provides a good description of (equivalence transformation
and natural deduction) propositional calculus.

The axioms of the equivalence transformation system are theorems in
the natural deduction system.

Extends propositional calculus to predicate calculus. (A predicate is
a generalized proposition for which expressions are not only composed
of boolean expressions (composed of the operators not, and, or,
implies and equal) but of any expression that has a boolean result (T
or F), including the existential, universal and numerical
quantifiers.)

The text gives an axiomatics semantics of a small language using the
notion of weakest pre-conditions. 

It is a very good reference for axiomatic semantics.}

		  An Introduction}},
	PUBLISHER = {Springer-Verlag},
	YEAR = {1979},
	Annotating = {

A good introduction to denotational semantics. 

He describes a tiny language (with only assignment, conditional and
iterative commands, and sequential composition of them, and read as
well as simple boolean and arithmethic expressions) and formalizes its
semantics.  He does this by formalizing the concept of a {\em
state\/}. This is done by defining the domains $State$, $Memory$,
$Input$, $Output$ and $Value$.

Then he defines denotations of expressions and of commands.  The
denotation of an expression $E$ is a function ${\bf E}[E]$ of type:
  
  \[ Exp\rightarrow[State\rightarrow[[Value\ X\ State + {error}]] \]

$State$ is needed the first time because the value of an expression
depends on what values are bound to identifiers in a state, and the
second time because the evaluation of an expression like $read$ may
change the state.

The denotation semantics of commands is to produce a new state or
generate an error, thus:

\[ C:Com\rightarrow[State\rightarrow[State + {error}]] \]

He then applies a semantic function (${\bf E}$ or ${\bf C}$,
respectively) to each syntactic form of expression and command.

He informally explains why he uses the word {\em domain\/} instead of
{\em set}: in order that recursive definitons of functions and sets
can always be solved.

This is only an introductory book. Any serious work based on
denotational semantics would have to be based on more advanced texts.

He uses denotational semantics to specify the meaning of various
common programming language constructs. He uses these specifications
to justify the proof rules of axiomatic semantics. Only partial
correctness is discussed. A good part of the more difficult sections
of the book is devoted to soundness proofs for proof rules concerning
recursion and blocks. Concurrency and non-determinism are not
considered in depth.

A good reference book for the subject of proving correctness of
sequential programs.

This book contain several chapters, by different authors. I've read so
far only the first four.

The first chapter ({\em Main Approaches to Formal Specifications\/},
by Peter Lucas) is a very short introduction to the subject of formal
specification, comprising the main ideas of denotational, operational
and axiomatic semantics.

The second chapter ({\em The Meta-Language\/}, by Cliff Jones)
provides a general description of the meta-language used in VDM.

The third chapter ({\em Mathematical Foundations\/}) is not a very
elucidating article about the mathematics of fixed points. It uses a
rather intricate `neighbourhood' approach, developed by Dana Scott.

The fourth chapter presents the denotational semantics of basic
constructs of programming languages. A useful introduction to the
denotational method using the VDM meta-language.

This report traces the most important steps in the history of research
on program verification. Its central issue is that the need to reason
about programs was apparent from their first creation; the research
challenge has been to find tractable methods. 

The history of work on the verification on sequential programs is
described in detail, from the pre-Hoare era (of works of Alan Turing,
John McCarthy, Robert Floyd and Peter Naur) to the post-Hoare era
(e.g. of works of Cliff Jones (VDM), Rodney Burstall, David Park, Hans
Bekic and Dana Scott (structural induction and language semantics)
etc). 

The way early results have been applied to change the way programs are
developed is also described.  

Considerations on coping with concurrent algorithms are made. Special
attention is drawn to the works of Hoare (CSP), Robin Milner (CCS and
$\pi$-calculus), temporal logic (Rodney Burstall and Amir Pnueli),
Leslie Lamport and others.}

The article is a step towards finding a compositional development
method for concurrent programs. A {\em transformational\/} style of
development (i.e. a concurrent program is developed from a sequential
one to which transformations are applied) for systems with limited
interference is proposed. The fact that the interface of an object is
constrained by the available methods simplifies reasoning about
interference (with respect to other approaches such as those using
shared variables).

I think there are some errors in this formal specification. Things
started reasonably well and clear, but then turned gloomy just at the
very heart of the subject. 

In the definition of the dynamic semantics of CSP, the rule specifying
the transition for the input command, which should be among the most
interesting and important, is incorrect. $v is the transition label,
but it has not been included in $\Lambda_c$ or $\Lambda_{gc}$. The
transition rule for the output command is again incorrect. This time
$v$ is a configuration, and it has not been included in $\Gamma_c$
(neither I think it should nor would it explain the rule itself). As
far as I can understand, the problem is with the rules themselves. 

The third rule for the parallel command (which should again be the
most important one) does not specify the change to $\sigma$, as I
think it should.

I did not understand as well which rule implied the appearance of the
string "B" in Example 5 (the one character buffer). 

At this point I stopped my reading. I was left with the impression
that it was a rather disappointing formal semantics, after all. To
overcome this unsatisfactory situation, I thought I'd better read
\ref{Gordon81} (though it was written before this report itself) and
then, if the situation persisted, I'd see if someone else in the
department could agree or disagree with me. }
