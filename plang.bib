	Annotating = {

Pascal `loopholes' on strong typing: procedure parameters and variant
records.

Good description of implementation of block-structured languages
(chap. 6).

Good overview of Lisp (chaps. 9, 10 & 11). 

No in-depth discussion, e.g. about practical use of recursion versus
iteration, features of Lisp that allows the definition of a mapping
function that takes a function and a list and returns the list applied
to the function (argument), the function argument being able to take
any number of arguments.

Illustrates the power of the function reduction and mapping
mechanisms.   

Gives the basic ideas of functional programming. A functional is
simply a function that has one or more functions as arguments or
delivers a function as its result. The motivation is to have a simple
way of combining existing functions to define new functions.

Good introductory overview of Backus functional (variable-free)
programming style.}
